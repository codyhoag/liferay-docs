- step I could be moved to II > A (i don't think it warrants its own top level I 
unless we plan to break it down in future)

- each step needs a 'title' and a 'summary', so title would be <50 chars, 
summary can be multiple sentences with links or actions
- we need to mention that the two categories we are upgrading are database and 
configuration and Liferay modules/plugins source code (Plugins SDKs or 
Workspacees), not just custom plugins
- remove 'production'?
- should we call them 'upgrade problems' or 'breaking changes'?
