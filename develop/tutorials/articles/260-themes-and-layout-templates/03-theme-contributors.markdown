# Theme Contributors [](id=theme-contributors)

If you would like to package UI resources, independent of a specific theme, and
include them on the page, Theme Contributors are the tool for you.

If instead you would like to include separate UI resources on the page that are
attached to a theme, you should look into [themelets](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/themelets).

A Theme Contributor is a [module](https://dev.liferay.com/participate/liferaypedia/-/wiki/Main/Module)
that contains UI resources to use in Liferay 7 and DXP. The module is scanned
for all valid CSS and JS files, and then includes the resources on the page.

You can therefore style these UI components as you like, and the styles will be
applied, regardless of the current theme.

This tutorial assumes that you have already created your module project. You can
learn how to create a module with [Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-modules-with-blade-cli).

This tutorial demonstrates how to:

- Identify a Theme Contributor Module
- Create a Theme Contributor Module

Now that you know what Theme Contributors are, you can learn how to configure
your module to be identified as one.

## Identifying Theme Contributor Modules [](id=identifying-theme-contributor-modules)

In Liferay versions prior to 7.0, the standard UI for User menus and navigation,
such as the Dockbar, was included in the theme template. Starting in Liferay 7.0,
these standard UI components are packaged as Theme Contributors.

Specifically, the Control Menu, Product Menu, and Simulation Panel, are packaged
in Theme Contributor modules in Liferay, removing them from a theme. Instead,
styles for these specific UI components can be handled outside of the theme.

![Figure 1: The Control Menu, Product Menu, and Simulation Panel are packaged as Theme Contributor modules.](../../images/theme-contributor-menus-diagram.png)

If you want to edit or style these standard UI components, you'll need to create your own
Theme Contributor and add your modifications on top. More on this in a bit.

To identify your module as a Theme Contributor add the
`Liferay-Theme-Contributor-Type` property to the `bnd.bnd` file:

For example the [Control Menu](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/modules/apps/web-experience/product-navigation/product-navigation-control-menu-theme-contributor/bnd.bnd)
has the configuration below:

    Bundle-Name: Liferay Product Navigation Control Menu Theme Contributor
    Bundle-SymbolicName: com.liferay.product.navigation.control.menu.theme.contributor
    Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
    Liferay-Releng-Module-Group-Description:
    Liferay-Releng-Module-Group-Title: Product Navigation
    Liferay-Theme-Contributor-Type: product-navigation-control-menu
    Web-ContextPath: /product-navigation-control-menu-theme-contributor
    -include: ../../../../../marketplace/web-content-management/bnd.bnd

+$$$

**Note:**  All Theme Contributor modules will also require a Web-ContextPath to
be set in the manifest.

<!-- leaving this section out for now, until it is developed further--

Alternatively, Theme Contributors can be identifed in the `package.json` file:

    {
        "name": "lfr-product-menu-animation-themelet",
        "liferayTheme": {
            themeContributorType?: product-navigation-control-menu
            "themelet": true,
            "version": "7.0"
        }
    }

If this property is set in either one of these ways, the module will then be
treated as a Theme Contributor.-->

Now that you can identify Theme Contributors, you can learn how to create them
next.

## Creating Theme Contributors [](id=creating-theme-contributors)

Theme contributors are, simply, packaged UI components, as mentioned earlier. To
create a Theme Contributor module, follow these
steps:

1.  Create a generic OSGi module using your favorite third party tool.

2.  Set the `Web-ContextPath` and `Liferay-Theme-Contributor-Type` headers in your
    `bnd.bnd` file. The Theme Contributor type metadata will help the system better
    identify your module. If you are creating it to override an existing theme
    contributor, you should try to use the same type to maximize compatibility with
    future developments.

3.  Create a `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources` directory for the module and
    place your resources (css and js) in there following your patterns of choice.

4.  Build and deploy your module to see your modifications applied across pages and themes.

That's all you need to do to create a Theme Contributor for your site. Remember,
with great power there must also comeâ€“great responsibility, so use theme
contributors wisely. The UI contributions will affect every page, and will
remain, regardless of the theme.

**Note:** Theme Contributors do not guarantee the resources insertion order. For example, if
you are creating one to override a specific css styling in a different module, you should
make sure your css selectors are more specific than the ones being overriden.
